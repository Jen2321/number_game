# The number guessing game

This is a number guessing game!

## Introduction

Create a number guessing game using Python. The game involves guessing a four-digit number where the digits range from 0 to 9 and should not repeat. The user provides their answer, and the game provides feedback where correct digits in the correct positions are represented as 'A', and correct digits in the wrong positions are represented as 'B'.

## Game Rules

1.Enter a four-digit guess, with each digit ranging from 0 to 9. Digits cannot be repeated.

2.If the entered digits are repeated or the format is incorrect, a message "請輸入正確的四位數字！" will be displayed.

3.'A' represents the count of digits that are both correct in value and position.

4.'B' represents the count of digits that are correct in value but in the wrong position.

For example, if the correct answer is "1234" and the user guesses "1567", the display will be "1A0B". If the user guesses "1256", the display will be "1A1B".

5.If all digits are correct in both value and position, a message "猜中了！正確答案是XXXX，你總共猜了XX次。" will be displayed.
